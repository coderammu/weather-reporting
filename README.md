## Project Title:

Weather Forecast Website

## Project Description:

This weather website provides users with real-time and forecasted weather information for any city worldwide. Users can search for a city, and the application first uses a geolocation API to retrieve its latitude and longitude. These coordinates are then passed to two different Open-Meteo API endpoints:

**Hourly Weather API –** Returns weather data for the current day, including temperature, weather type (e.g., sunny, rainy, foggy), and wind speed on an hourly basis.

**Daily Weather API –** Provides a 7-day forecast with daily summaries, covering temperature trends, weather conditions, and wind speed.

The interface is designed to be clean and user-friendly, giving users a simple yet informative view of weather data.
